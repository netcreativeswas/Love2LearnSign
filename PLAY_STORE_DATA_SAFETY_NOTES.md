# Play Console “Data safety” notes (engineering view)

This file is **not legal advice**. It’s an internal checklist to help fill in the Google Play Console “Data safety” form consistently with the codebase.

## Account deletion

- **In-app**: Settings → **Delete account** (requires typing `DELETE`). This calls the callable Cloud Function `deleteMyAccount` and deletes:
  - `users/{uid}` (+ subcollections like `entitlements/*`)
  - `user_counters/{uid}`
  - `userTenants/{uid}`
  - `tenants/*/members/{uid}` (best-effort)
  - other per-user collections (`favorites`, `quizHistory`, `reminders`, `reviewLists`, `sessionCounters`)
  - Firebase Auth user
- **Web fallback**: `https://www.love2learnsign.com/delete-account`

## Data the app handles (high-level)

### Collected / provided by user

- **Email**: used for sign-in/sign-up (Firebase Auth).
- **Country selection**: onboarding + product experience.
- **Hearing status (demographic)**: onboarding + analytics/content planning.
- **Favorites / history / quiz settings**: learning experience.

### Collected automatically / generated by app

- **Advertising ID (AD_ID)**: used by Google Mobile Ads / AdMob (non-premium users). Consent is handled via Google UMP (EU/UK).
- **Usage counters**: video views, game sessions, free token/session counters (Firestore).
- **Anonymous dictionary search analytics**: query + category + result count, stored without user IDs.
- **Device identifiers & IP (anti-abuse)**:
  - Device info via `device_info_plus`
  - External IP lookup via `https://api.ipify.org?format=json` (see `SecurityService`)
  - Used for rate limiting / abuse prevention (not for marketing).
- **Push notification tokens**: Firebase Cloud Messaging token (only if notifications are enabled).

### Purchases

- **Subscriptions**: processed by Google Play / App Store.
- App stores retain transaction records under their own policies (we don’t control retention).

## Third-party SDKs/services (core)

- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions, Messaging, App Check.
- **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)**: ads + consent (UMP).
- **App stores**: billing.

## Suggested Play Console answers (sanity check)

- **Account deletion**: yes (in-app + web).
- **Data shared**: likely “shared with third parties” for ads (AdMob) and for essential service providers (Firebase).
- **Data collection**: includes identifiers (Advertising ID), account info (email), app activity (usage counters), and diagnostics.

> Final answers must match what you actually enable in production builds and what your Firebase/AdMob configurations collect.
