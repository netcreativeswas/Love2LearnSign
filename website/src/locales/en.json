    "faqA1": "Co-branding means we publish a dictionary experience powered by this platform while keeping Love to Learn Sign visible alongside your organization’s identity (name, logo, and messaging). It’s a fast way to launch with shared branding and shared maintenance.",

    "faqQ3": "Do you support sign languages beyond Bangla Sign Language?",
    "faqA3": "Yes. The platform is designed so other sign languages can benefit from the same learning flow: dictionary browsing, short videos, favorites, and practice features. Each dictionary can be handled as its own dedicated space.",
    "faqQ4": "How does revenue sharing work (ads and subscriptions)?",
    "faqA4": "We can organize monetization per dictionary. The general approach is that ad revenue for a given dictionary is paid back to the organization operating that dictionary on the platform. Subscription details depend on your setup, so we discuss the exact model together.",
    "faqQ5": "Who owns the content?",
    "faqA5": "You keep ownership of your sign language content and the videos you record. In co-branding, we align on a shared video format for consistency (L2L Video Editor is provided to crop/trim). In white-label, format is flexible. In all cases, the platform itself is provided via a licence/subscription to use the product and infrastructure.",
    "faqQ6": "How do we get started?",
    "faqA6": "Send a message with your sign language, expected content size, and your preferred option (co-branding or white-label). We’ll reply with questions, a proposed setup, and next steps.",
    "faqQ7": "Who creates the videos, and what format should they follow?",
    "faqA7": "Partners create the sign videos. For co-branding, videos should match the existing Love to Learn Sign format; we provide L2L Video Editor to help you crop and trim to the standard. For white-label, video format is flexible (we can still recommend a consistent format).",
    "faqQ8": "Is this a one-time purchase?",
