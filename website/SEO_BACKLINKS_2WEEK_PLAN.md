# 2‑Week Backlinks & Partner Outreach Plan (Love to Learn Sign)

Goal: increase referring domains and high-quality links to improve “External factors” SEO signals.

Primary landing pages to link to:
- Home: `https://www.love2learnsign.com/`
- Partner page: `https://www.love2learnsign.com/collaboration`

## Week 1 — Easy wins (set up a strong baseline)

### Day 1: Make sure every official profile links back
- Add website link in every social profile “bio” / “about” field:
  - Use `https://www.love2learnsign.com/`
  - Add a second link (if allowed) to `https://www.love2learnsign.com/collaboration`
- Pin a post on the main social accounts with the website link (and mention the app + collaboration).

### Day 2: App store + product directories
- Google Play listing:
  - Ensure the “Developer website” points to `https://www.love2learnsign.com/`
  - Add the partner URL in the description (natural sentence, not spam).
- Create/refresh listings on app/product directories (pick a small set and do them well):
  - Fill in: category, short description, long description, screenshots, and website URL.
  - Use consistent branding: “Love to Learn Sign” + “Bangla Sign Language”.

### Day 3: Partner page conversion
- Re-read `/collaboration` and ensure the CTA is clear:
  - “Contact us” (email + form/page) is obvious
  - Offer 2 options: co-branding vs white-label
- Add a short “Press/Media kit” paragraph (optional) so partners can reuse text + logo.

### Day 4–5: Community links (relevant > many)
- Identify 10 relevant websites (high relevance matters more than quantity):
  - Deaf associations, sign language schools, NGOs, education projects, accessibility blogs.
- For each, find a “resources” page or “partners” page where a link makes sense.

## Week 2 — Outreach (quality links)

### Outreach list (target 10, aim for 3–5 links)
- 3 Deaf associations (Bangladesh + international)
- 3 sign language teachers/schools
- 2 NGOs / accessibility orgs
- 2 universities / research groups (language/education)

### Email template (short, high conversion)
Subject ideas:
- “Partnership / co-branding for a sign language dictionary”
- “Resource suggestion: Bangla Sign Language learning app”

Email body:
1) Who you are (1 sentence)
2) What the project does (1–2 sentences)
3) Why it’s relevant to them (1 sentence)
4) The ask (1 clear action):
   - “Could you add us to your resources/partners page with a link?”
   - Provide both URLs (home + collaboration)
5) Offer support (1 sentence):
   - “I can provide a short blurb + logo if needed.”

### Follow-up (important)
- Follow up once after 5–7 days with a short reminder.

## Tracking (simple)
- Google Search Console:
  - Monitor “Links” → “Top linking sites” weekly.
  - Watch “Pages” indexing for `/collaboration` and `/` and `/bn`.
- Keep a spreadsheet:
  - Site contacted, contact email, date, status, link URL (if obtained).

## Quality rules (avoid spam)
- Prefer **relevant** sites over generic backlink farms.
- Avoid low-quality directories that look spammy.
- Use natural anchor text (mix of):
  - “Love to Learn Sign”
  - “Bangla Sign Language learning app”
  - “Bangla Sign Language dictionary”
